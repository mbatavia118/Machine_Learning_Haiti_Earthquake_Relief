# Machine_Learning_Haiti_Earthquake_Relief

Course project for Statistical Learning, completed by Mariska Batavia in August 2022.

The purpose of this project was to use aerial photographs of Haiti after the destructive 2010 earthquake to locate blue tarps, which are indicative of displaced persons in need of humanitarian aid. The training data set consisted of 63,241 individual pixels, each with a red, green, and blue color value (all numeric), as well as a class assignment that indicated whether a pixel was a blue tarp, vegetation, soil, rooftop, or something else. Using this data set, I built seven classification models using different methods: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbor, penalized fit logistic regression (ridge regression), random forest, and the support vector machine. I then tested these seven models on a larger holdout data set of over 2 million individual pixels.

Further details can be found in the final report, which is a PDF version of the rmd file.
